## The Final Continue
A twine interactive novel game is based around the player making two moral choices. You are playing as a kidnapped lady from the bar, trapped inside a three story arcade and soon to realize that there is another lady that was kidnapped alongside you. Each floor comes with an outcome that will have you testing your morals, but each outcome will lead you to the next floor. There are three endings, best of luck to you.
